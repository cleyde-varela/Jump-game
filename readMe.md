## ðŸ“Œ The reason behind it
I built this game in order to better explain simple programming concepts and the relation between HTML, CSS, and Js to highschoolers during a *volunteering program* in which I participated with my university, **"Engenheiras por 1 dia"** (more info in https://engenheirasporumdia.pt/).

## ðŸ“Œ How to use it
You can run the code on your local machine using Visual Studio Code for example. Happy gaming!ðŸ‘‹
