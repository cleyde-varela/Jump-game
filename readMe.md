# Jump Game

## ðŸ“Œ About this project
* It's a simple game developed using HTML, CSS and Js.
* It was built following the amazing tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9buAwVBDhA&list=PLeXXJg5jfu7xzPwnu3Sc3LgzeVQtmfWQm&index=25&t=123s by **Manual do Developer**
* I used some images from https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-animation-frames-element-collection_33591464.htm

## ðŸ“Œ The reason behind it
I built this game in order to better explain simple programming concepts and the relation between HTML, CSS, and Js to highschoolers during a *volunteering program* in which I participated with my university, **"Engenheiras por 1 dia"** (more info in https://engenheirasporumdia.pt/).
